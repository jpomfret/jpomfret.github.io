I have video courses available on LinkedIn Learning on a variety of topics from SQL to dbatools. This requires a subscription but if you don't have one reach out to me and I can share a free course with you.

- [Jess Pomfret Author Page](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/instructors/jess-pomfret)
  - [Automating SQL Server with dbatools](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/automating-sql-server-with-dbatools) - It's no secret that I love dbatools, and this course is the perfect introduction to the tool. This course will also provide you with some great real world use cases.
  - [Level Up: Advanced SQL](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/level-up-advanced-sql) - I think the format of this course is really interesting. I set challenges, you solved them, and then I talk through my answer. The neat part is that the course includes a dev container where you can work with the same environment as me - no need to install anything!
  - [Introduction to Transact-SQL](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/introduction-to-transact-sql-22864585) - If you're just starting out with SQL Server then this course will be perfect for learning T-SQL basics.
  - ********... - I'm not allowed to reveal the course yet, but there is another one launching January 2025 that I'm excited to share with you all.
