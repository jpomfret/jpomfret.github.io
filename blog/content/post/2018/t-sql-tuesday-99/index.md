First off, welcome to my first T-SQL Tuesday which seems like the perfect first blog post to introduce myself and my non-SQL Server life.  Starting this blog and becoming more involved with the SQL Server community (read speaking) is my goal for 2018 so here goes nothing. Thanks to [Aaron Bertrand](http://twitter.com/AaronBertrand) for hosting and picking a great topic.

I was born in Oxford, England before my family moved to the small market town of [Chippenham, Wiltshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chippenham) where I was raised.  Leading to my main passion being proper football. We can argue about why this is the proper football in a later post perhaps (hint: you use your feet to kick a ball, no hands or egg-shaped objects here).

My earliest memories involve playing and watching football. When I was in primary school (equivalent of elementary school in the USA) my mum fought with the headmistress until I was allowed to play on the boy’s team.  The boys weren’t particularly happy until they realized I could hold my own.

I then played for Chippenham Town Ladies for many seasons while I was in Secondary School and earned appearances for the Wiltshire County team.  Next I joined the Bristol Academy of Sport at Filton College for the 2003/2004 season and played for Bristol Rovers Ladies.  This set up my big move across the pond as I was recruited to join [The University of Akron Zips](http://gozips.com/) in 2005.  After four fantastic years of playing football every day and travelling around the United States, I graduated in 2009 with a degree in Information Systems and eBusiness, followed by an MBA.  Then in 2011 accidentally became a DBA for a direct marketing company in Akron.

I have since moved employers but still reside in Northeast Ohio as a SQL Server DBA.  My days of playing football are behind me, but I now spend more time than I probably should watching the English Premier League and worrying about my [fantasy (proper) football](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/a/team/991342) team. I also enjoy watching US sports, hiking, Crossfiting and travelling with my partner, Kelcie.
